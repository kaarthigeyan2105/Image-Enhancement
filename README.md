# Image-Enhancement
Image enhancement is the process of improving the quality and appearance of an image. 
It can be used to correct flaws or defects in an image, or to simply make an image more visually appealing.
Image enhancement techniques can be applied to a wide range of images, including photographs, scans, and digital images. 
Some common goals of image enhancement include increasing contrast, sharpness, and colorfulness; reducing noise and blur; and correcting distortion and other defects. 
Image enhancement techniques can be applied manually using image editing software, or automatically using algorithms and computer programs such as OpenCV.
